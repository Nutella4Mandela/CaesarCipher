# CaesarCipher
This code encripts your secret message using a method called Caesar Cipher. It takes every letter of your message and shift it three places to the right. For example, A becomes D, B becomes E, C becomes F, and “attack” becomes “dwwdfn”. The only way to reverse the process is by shifting each letter three places to the left. This project is more of a practice, helping me turn a string into arrays of letters so I can change positions, encrypting the message.
